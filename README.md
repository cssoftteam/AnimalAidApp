Since all applications developed by our team are under NDA with clients, we can showcase the first non-commercial project of our team, the Animal Aid App.

This application helps animal shelters share their news with everyone interested. Any shelter can connect to this application and publish their news. And the end user will be able to read news from all shelters in one place with convenient filters.

## Features:

- **Shelter News Sharing**
- **City Filtering**
- **Convenient News Feed**
- **Multi-language Support**
- **Dark/Light Theme**

## Benefits:

- **Increased Awareness:** By allowing animal shelters to share their news, the app raises awareness about the issue of abandoned animals and encourages community engagement.

- **Streamlined Access:** City filtering ensures users can easily find shelters and news relevant to their location, facilitating local support and involvement.

- **Enhanced User Experience:** The app offers a convenient news feed, allowing users to stay updated on shelter activities effortlessly. The ability to add posts to favorites and view original content on shelter websites improves user engagement.

- **Inclusivity:** Localization in multiple languages makes the app accessible to a wider audience, fostering inclusivity and enabling participation from diverse communities.

- **Personalization:** The option to switch between dark and light themes caters to user preferences, enhancing comfort and usability based on individual needs and preferences.
